# React sample project

This project is a sample to show my skills on react.
I have used functional component of react.
### About the sample
  This sample has a sample list ,just to show how I populate the lists on the component and 
  to show the use of api on my components and display them in different components so any other component
  can share the data which is been fetch from api.

  The second part of this project is the show case of reducers from React hook.
   In this part I have used the reducer and display the increment and decrement of the coun based on
    the type of action using the dispatch functionality of the useReducer of React hook.

  The third part of this project is the Error handeling technique of React.
   In this part I have used a simple BMI calculator to show that if you try to put 0 on the height
   field ,since it is not allowed to divided any number by 0 ,it will show the error message saying that
   it is not allowed to divided by 0.
